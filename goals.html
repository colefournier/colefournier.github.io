<p>I'm going to the University of Maine with the major oh Business Management with a concentration of Entrepreneurship. I love entrepreneurship and have been doing it for sometime now with the creations of my businesses. Entrepreneurship has been a big part of growing as well because my parents have created and owned a bunch of businesses as I was younger and still now. So I have seen the work they have done and loved seeing what they wanted to create and then turning it into a profitable business. I also love the idea of owning my own business, making profits from something I created, giving jobs to my local community, and giving back to my community with a local business. Thats why I feel like entrepreneurship is a good route for me which I will follow to pursue.</p>

<p>One of my Maine goals is to startup a board company that would sell Snowboarding, Wakeboarding, Wakesurfing, and Skating equipment and any other things involving these sports. I'm really involved with these sports and know all about them, so I feel enjoy the thought of being able to educate people more and push these sports to be even bigger while making money from it. I'm close with someone back home who used to be one of my teachers in high school and quit to open his own shop and he loves it. I always talk to him about the shop to learn more and more about it and figure everything out. It's defiantly something I want to accomplish as I grow older.</p>

<p>Another thing I want to do is grow my social media up quite a bit. As of now with all my accounts I have around 75K followers throughout Instagram but I want to grow it. Theres a lot of money on Instagram that people don't know about and I want to capture that. I'm starting another account soon but just need to find out about a specific niche so I can specialize in a certain field, as that brings in more money because only specific companies about that field will contact you.I've been on social media for a couple years now and know a decent amount on how to grow an account fast and gain followers to grow your page within months.<strong>Below is one of my Instagram accounts I own.</strong></p>
