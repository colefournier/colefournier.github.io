<p>My name is Cole Fournier, I am 18 years of age, and now currently attending the University of Maine. I've always lived in Maine but my family and I love to travel and visit new places. At age 18 I've been to 32 different states and looking to complete all 50 states before I grow too old.</p>

<p>I live in Biddeford Maine which is roughly 20 minutes from Portland, It's located right on the ocean and is a popular vacation spot for a lot of tourists throughout summer months. Most of my summers days I spend on Long lake in Naples Maine. I work up there and we also have a house on the lake so I usually live up there throughout summer.<p>
